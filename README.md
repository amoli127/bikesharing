## Overview of Project

This analysis aims to gain insight using Citi Bike's data on the use of its bicycles in New York City. The data will create visualizations for investors and illustrate how feasible it would be to create a similar system in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

When analyzing the data from Citi Bike, we can see in the graph on the left that most users use bicycles for approximately 5 minutes. Then in the graph on the right, we see a breakdown by gender, and we can see that, in the majority, males are the ones who use the bicycles for an approximate time of 5 minutes, while on the other hand, women use them for an approximate time of 6 minutes.
