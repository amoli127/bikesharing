## Overview of Project

This analysis aims to gain insight using Citi Bike's data on the use of its bicycles in New York City. The data will create visualizations for investors and illustrate how feasible it would be to create a similar system in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

When analyzing the data from Citi Bike, we can see in the graph on the left that most users use bicycles for approximately 5 minutes. Then in the graph on the right, we see a breakdown by gender, and we can see that, in the majority, males are the ones who use the bicycles for an approximate time of 5 minutes, while on the other hand, women use them for an approximate time of 6 minutes.

Another insight we can observe in the Citi Bike data is during which time and day of the week the bikes were used the most. The heatmap on the left shows that the day users used the most bicycles was Thursday at 6 PM. Then in the middle heatmap, we can see a breakdown by gender, and we can see that the majority of people of the male gender were the ones who used the bikes on Thursday at 6 PM. Finally, in the heatmap on the right, we have a breakdown of which part of the users are subscribers to the Citi Bike service and what day and time they use it the most.

One of the most critical points we could gather from the Citi bike data was the locations from which most users started their trips and the areas in which most users ended their trips.
